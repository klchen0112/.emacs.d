* Emacs
** File Layout
*** Features
You'll notice several headings tagged with =@{feature}= like in =@mail=, these
subtrees will only be tangled if *at least one* of those features are enabled when
the config is built.

*** init.el
Everything is tangled into =init.el= by default and I don't really make any
attempt to keep this file organized since it's not really intended to be
interacted with.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

*** early-init.el :early:
=early-init.el= is tangled from the subtrees that are tagged with =early= and it
should only be used to do minimal configuration that needs to occur early in the
load sequence.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;; early-init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src
